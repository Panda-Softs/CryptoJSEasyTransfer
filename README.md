# Crypto JS EasyTransfer
Easy way to safely transfer encrypted AES-512-CBC file embedded into an simple HTML file.



## How to proceed

1. Download the empty CryptoJS HTML container from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/naturosofts/CryptoJSEasyTransfer/master/dist/CJSET.html).
2. Enter any password and select a file to encrypt by clicking on the "ENCRYPT FILE" button.
3. After successful encryption, a new HTML file called "`cryptojs_transfer_<timestamp>.html`" containing your encrypted file by an AES algorithm 512 key size in CBC mode will be automatically generated by your browser.
4. Save or transmit this file to its destination.
5. Reopen this file "`cryptojs_transfer_<timestamp>.html`" at destination in your browser and enter the password used when encrypting it. To recover your decrypted file in this original form, press the "DECRYT NOW" button. The original file will be produced and downloadable by your browser.
6. You are done.
7. The same file can be used for another transfer by pressing the "NEW" button. The encrypted content of the previous transfer will be completely erased.
